# 🎵 Knowledge Playlist  

**A web app that totally solves my tutorial hell problem**  

## 🚀 About This Project  

**Knowledge Playlist** is a dedicated learning web app designed to help users escape tutorial hell. Unlike YouTube, where distractions are everywhere, this app provides a focused learning environment where you control your learning path.  

With **Knowledge Playlist**, you can:  
✅ Add and organize learning resources (YouTube videos, docs, articles, etc.).  
✅ Track your progress manually as you complete lessons.  
✅ Embed content in real-time so everything is available inside the app.  
✅ Learn without distractions in a dedicated platform.  

For now, the project has **CRUD functionalities** and **content embedding**, but I plan to enhance it with more powerful features in the future. Stay tuned! 🚀
